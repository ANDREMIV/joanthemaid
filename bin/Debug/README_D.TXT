* The EXTRA keys contain round corners.  The keys  (x),  (X),  (.), and  (:)
  contain auxiliary symbols to indicate individual movements of the  pieces.

NOTE: Also you find borders with the coordinates of chessboard.  For  simple
      borders, type the ASCII codes  from  0192  to  0207,  and  for  double
      borders from 0224 to 0239.  Don't forget to type [Alt]  and  the  ZERO
      which goes with each code to generate these characters. 
      
      The figurine notation pieces are in the ASCII codes from 0162 to 0167.
